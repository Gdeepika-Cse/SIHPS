# Problem Title

SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations

# Problem Description

# Background:

Railway stations are intricate environments with a variety of essential services such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Navigating these spaces can be overwhelming, particularly in large or unfamiliar stations.

# Challenge:

Designing a user-centric navigation system that improves the travel experience, minimizes confusion, and ensures accessibility for all passengers, including those with disabilities.

# Expected Solution:

A multi-platform, real-time navigation system comprising:

A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step directions.

Digital kiosks with touch-screen navigation systems installed at multiple points within the station.

Voice-guided navigation features to assist visually impaired users.

Dynamic updates reflecting real-time changes in layouts and facility positions.

Seamless integration with existing Indian Railways apps for ticketing and schedules.

# Problem Creator's Organization

Ministry of Railways

# Idea

To develop "SmartRail Nav", an intuitive, scalable navigation solution that:

Helps passengers locate facilities using indoor positioning technology.

Offers accessibility-first design (voice support, large icons, contrast modes).

Provides real-time updates on train platforms, facility availability (e.g., restrooms, ATMs).

Connects with Indian Railwaysâ€™ existing digital ecosystem.

# Use Cases
# New Passenger Navigation:

A first-time traveler arrives at a major railway station and uses the app to locate the ticket counter, platform, and restroom.

# Visually Impaired Support:

A visually impaired user enables the voice navigation mode and receives step-by-step audio cues to reach the waiting area.

# Real-time Platform Change Notification:

The app notifies passengers when there is a platform change and updates the route accordingly.

# Kiosk-Based Directions:

A passenger uses a station kiosk to find the shortest route to a cloakroom and food court before boarding.

# Technology Stack
# Frontend:

Flutter (Cross-platform app development)

React (for digital kiosk UI)

# Backend:

Node.js with Express.js

Firebase / MongoDB (Real-time database)

# Navigation & Maps:

Mapbox or Google Indoor Maps API

Bluetooth Beacons / QR Codes for indoor positioning

Accessibility Features:

Text-to-Speech APIs

Speech Recognition APIs

# Dependencies

Indian Railways API (Train schedules, station info)

Indoor Mapping Providers (Mapbox, HERE Maps)

Bluetooth beacon hardware for indoor tracking

Cloud services (Firebase, AWS, or Azure)

Accessibility libraries for screen readers and voice guidance
